- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application
- **AI SDK**: Unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs

### Database and Storage
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database operations
- **Vercel Postgres**: For data persistence
- **Vercel Blob**: For file storage

### Authentication
- **NextAuth/Auth.js 5.0**: For user authentication

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library based on Radix UI primitives
- **Radix UI**: For accessible and customizable UI components
- **Lucide React**: For icons
- **Tailwind Merge**: For combining Tailwind classes

### Code Quality
- **ESLint**: For code linting
- **Biome**: For code formatting and linting

### Testing
- **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing

## Project Structure

### Main Directories
- **/app**: Contains the Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - **/app/(chat)**: Main chat functionality
  - **/app/(auth)**: Authentication related pages
- **/components**: UI components
  - **/components/ui**: Base UI components
- **/lib**: Core functionality and utilities
  - **/lib/ai**: AI-related code including models, providers, and tools
  - **/lib/db**: Database schema and operations
  - **/lib/editor**: Code editor functionality
  - **/lib/artifacts**: Handling of artifacts (files, images, etc.)
- **/hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management and functionality
- **/public**: Static assets
- **/tests**: End-to-end tests with Playwright

### Key Components
- **Chat Interface**: Components for rendering chat messages, inputs, and interactions
- **AI Integration**: Tools for connecting to various AI model providers
- **Markdown Support**: Rendering of markdown content in chat
- **Code Editor**: In-app code editing capabilities
- **File Handling**: Upload, preview, and management of files

## AI Features
- Support for multiple AI model providers (xAI Grok by default, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Streaming responses
- Multimodal inputs (text, images, files)
- Structured outputs
- Tool calling capabilities

## Authentication
The application uses Auth.js (formerly NextAuth) for authentication, supporting various authentication providers.

## Data Persistence
User data, chat history, and other state are stored in Postgres via Drizzle ORM. Files are stored using Vercel Blob.

### Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- **User**: Stores user information (id, email, password)
- **Chat**: Represents chat sessions (id, createdAt, title, userId, visibility)
- **Message_v2**: Stores chat messages (id, chatId, role, parts, attachments, createdAt)
- **Vote_v2**: Tracks message votes (chatId, messageId, isUpvoted)
- **Document**: Stores documents (id, createdAt, title, content, kind, userId)
- **Suggestion**: Stores suggestions for documents (id, documentId, originalText, suggestedText, etc.)

There are also some deprecated tables (Message, Vote) that are maintained for backward compatibility.

## User Interface
The application features a modern, responsive UI with:

- Chat interface with message history
- Message threading and organization
- Multimodal input allowing text, code, and file uploads
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Document viewer
- Sidebar for navigation and history
- Theme support (light/dark mode)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Custom Hooks
The application uses several custom React hooks to manage state and encapsulate functionality:

- **use-artifact**: Manages the creation and manipulation of artifacts (documents, code, etc.)
- **use-chat-visibility**: Handles the visibility settings of chat sessions (public/private)
- **use-mobile**: Detects mobile devices for responsive UI adjustments

## Development
- Uses PNPM as the package manager
- Supports various development commands for database operations, testing, and linting
- Configuration for ESLint, TypeScript, and Biome for code quality
- Database migrations using Drizzle ORM

## Running Locally
To run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables (see .env.example)
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Run development server: `pnpm dev`

## Deployment
The application is designed to be deployed on Vercel with integrations for:
- Authentication
- Postgres database
- Blob storage

## Additional Features
- Markdown rendering for rich text support
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- File upload and handling
- Document creation and editing
- Suggestions and feedback system
- Public/private chat visibility options

## Conclusion
This codebase represents a sophisticated AI chatbot application with a modern tech stack and extensive features. It's designed to be extensible, maintainable, and deployable to production environments. The architecture follows best practices for Next.js applications, with clear separation of concerns and a focus on performance and user experience.
