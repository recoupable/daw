# DAW Project Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to transform our existing AI chatbot application into a browser-based, multiplayer Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) powered by generative AI, as specified in the PRD.

## Advantages of Existing Codebase
- **Next.js/React/TypeScript**: Already well-structured for web application development
- **AI SDK**: Can be adapted for audio generation prompts
- **Vercel Blob Storage**: Can be repurposed for audio file storage
- **Authentication**: Already in place via Auth.js
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with Postgres can be extended for DAW projects
- **UI Components**: Existing shadcn/ui components provide a strong foundation
- **Real-time capabilities**: We can leverage existing chat infrastructure for collaboration

## Implementation Strategy: Minimum Viable Changes

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Adaptation

1. **Extend Database Schema**
   - Add tables for audio blocks, tracks, and projects
   - Modify existing chat schema to support audio prompts and responses

2. **Audio File Handling**
   - Adapt Vercel Blob storage for audio files
   - Implement audio metadata extraction for uploads (BPM, key)
   - Create audio preview functionality

3. **AI Integration**
   - Integrate with MUREKA.ai API (or alternative)
   - Modify prompt handling to support music generation contexts
   - Build caching system for generated audio

### Phase 2: UI Development

1. **Timeline Grid Components**
   - Develop track lanes component
   - Create timeline with bar divisions
   - Implement snap-to-grid functionality

2. **Audio Block Components**
   - Develop waveform visualization (using WaveSurfer.js)
   - Create draggable/resizable audio blocks
   - Add play/mute/solo controls

3. **Transport Controls**
   - Build play/pause/stop functionality
   - Implement BPM and key selection
   - Add timeline position indicator

4. **Chat-to-Block Interface**
   - Adapt existing chat UI for audio generation
   - Create region selection mechanism
   - Link prompt submission to block generation

### Phase 3: Audio Engine

1. **Playback System**
   - Implement Tone.js for synchronized playback
   - Develop track mixing capabilities
   - Create master output channel

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Basic volume/pan controls
   - Simple effects (if time permits)
   - Audio export functionality

### Phase 4: Collaboration Features

1. **Real-time Synchronization**
   - Implement Liveblocks (or adapt existing real-time infrastructure)
   - Sync timeline state between users
   - Show cursor positions and active users

2. **Project Management**
   - Save/load functionality
   - Project sharing capabilities
   - Export options (full mix, stems)

## Technical Dependencies to Add

1. **Audio Libraries**
   - Tone.js for audio scheduling and playback
   - WaveSurfer.js for waveform visualization
   - Web Audio API utilities

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - React-draggable (or similar) for block manipulation
   - Timeline grid visualization library (or custom implementation)

3. **Third-party Services**
   - MUREKA.ai API integration for generative audio (or alternative)
   - Liveblocks for collaboration (if not using existing infrastructure)

## Migration Path

1. **Create New Routes/Pages**
   - `/daw` - Main DAW interface
   - `/projects` - Project management
   - Keep existing chat functionality as fallback/alternative

2. **Incremental Feature Rollout**
   - Start with basic timeline and audio block display
   - Add generation capabilities
   - Implement drag-and-drop
   - Add real-time collaboration
   - Enable project management

3. **Leverage Existing Components**
   - Adapt chat interface for audio prompts
   - Use authentication for project ownership
   - Modify file upload for audio files

## MVP Success Criteria

1. Users can generate audio via text prompts
2. Audio can be arranged on a timeline
3. Basic playback works with proper synchronization
4. Users can upload their own audio
5. Projects can be saved and loaded
6. Multiple users can collaborate in real-time
7. Projects can be exported as audio files

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with required dependencies
2. Create database migration for DAW-specific schema
3. Build prototype of timeline UI
4. Implement basic audio block component
5. Connect to generative audio API

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks

### Audio Generation API
- MUREKA.ai may not be readily available or could have integration challenges
- Audio generation quality may not meet expectations initially
- Generation latency could disrupt user flow (users expecting immediate results)
- API costs could scale quickly with heavy usage

### Browser Audio Processing
- Web Audio API has performance limitations, especially with multiple tracks
- Memory management will be crucial for larger projects
- Mobile browser compatibility might be limited
- Audio processing is CPU-intensive and could affect overall app performance

### Real-time Collaboration
- Audio state synchronization is significantly more complex than text
- Large audio files create bandwidth challenges for real-time sharing
- Conflict resolution when multiple users modify the same timeline region
- Latency issues could make collaboration feel disjointed

### Technical Implementation
- Building a responsive timeline with proper grid snapping is complex
- Tone.js integration might require significant customization
- Waveform rendering at scale could impact performance
- Accurate BPM/key detection from uploaded files isn't always reliable

### Storage and Scaling
- Audio files are much larger than text data, potentially hitting storage limits
- Vercel Blob has size/bandwidth limitations that might affect scaling
- Database schema extensions will require careful migration planning

### User Experience
- The transition from chat-based interface to DAW interface requires thoughtful UX
- Audio playback timing precision is critical but challenging in web environments
- Learning curve for users familiar with the chat app but not with DAW concepts

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- Create proof-of-concept for critical components before full implementation
- Research alternative audio generation APIs as backup options
- Consider limiting initial track count to improve performance
- Implement progressive loading for audio files to manage memory usage
- Start with simplified collaboration features and expand based on performance testing
